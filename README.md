## shopping for book scanners

: Rationale
Ever so often, I get reading assignments that are, well, horrid 2-up scans of printed books.  At least to my neuroatypical addled brain, that's really hard to process, so I'm considering investing in a portable book scanner.  This is also a practice R project.  My pattern up until this (Spring-2024) semester has been to whip up a spreadsheet when I'm doing a bit of low stakes research like this, but after having taken an R/Tidyverse-focused stat course, I'm inclined to approach this with R instead.
